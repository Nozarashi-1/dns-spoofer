## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nozarashi-1/dns-spoofer.git
cd dns-spoofer
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

First, enable packet forwarding:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Set up iptables to forward packets to the NFQUEUE:

    sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0    

(For testing on your own machine, you can use OUTPUT and INPUT chains instead of FORWARD.)

# Run the script:

    sudo python dns_spoof.py -w "www.example.com" -m "192.168.1.100"

# When finished, restore firewall rules:

    sudo iptables --flush
